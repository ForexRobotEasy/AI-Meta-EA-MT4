# AI Meta EA MT4

This is a trading robot developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. It utilizes neural networks and hidden algorithms to predict market movements and execute buy or sell orders based on the predictions.

## Functionality

The code consists of several functions that work together to execute trading orders. Here is an overview of each function:

### OnTick()

This is the entry point for the trading robot. It checks if there are any open positions. If there are no open positions, it calls the `GetMarketPrediction()` function to get the market prediction, and then calls the `CalculatePositionSize()` function to calculate the position size based on risk tolerance. Finally, it executes the buy or sell order based on the market prediction.

### GetMarketPrediction()

This function is responsible for predicting market movements using neural networks and hidden algorithms. Currently, it returns a placeholder value of 0.5. The actual implementation of this function should be done by the user, using their own prediction algorithms.

### CalculatePositionSize()

This function calculates the position size based on risk tolerance. Currently, it returns a placeholder value of 0.01. The actual calculation of the position size should be done by the user, based on their own risk management strategy.

### ExecuteOrder(int type, double positionSize)

This function executes the buy or sell order with the specified position size. It takes two parameters: `type`, which specifies the order type (OP_BUY or OP_SELL), and `positionSize`, which specifies the position size for the order. Currently, it contains example code to execute a buy or sell order using the provided position size. The user should replace this code with their own order execution logic.

### PositionsTotal()

This function returns the total number of open positions. Currently, it returns a placeholder value of 0. The user should implement their own logic to calculate the actual number of open positions.
